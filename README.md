💡 Project Title: Expense Handler – Smart Budget Tracker

✨ Key Features
✅ Add / Edit / Delete expenses on the fly
✅ Live Total Calculation updates in real-time
✅ Dark / Light Theme Toggle for visual comfort 🌗
✅ Responsive Design for mobile and desktop devices 📱💻
✅ LocalStorage Integration for data persistence 🔒

⚙️ JavaScript (ES6) for logic and dynamic DOM manipulation

🌙 Dark Mode Implementation for accessibility
